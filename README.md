# jupyter-exploration
# The purpose of this lab is essentially to learn how to use jupyter notebooks and how to upload them and integrate them into GitHub. We are tasked with opening a Jupyter notebook through Anaconda Distribution, making basic use of a Code cell and a Markdown cell, and then uploading the file onto our GitHub repository.
